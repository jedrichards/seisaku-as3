# Seisaku Lib
## AS3 library developed by [Seisaku Ltd](http://www.seisaku.co.uk)
A set of battle hardened constantly improved generic classes and utilities. At its core is a base class for view components called `HideableSprite` that provides a robust API for show/hide operations. Please feel free to use the library in whole, or in part, in anyway you see fit.

Documentation can be found [here](http://www.seisaku.co.uk/docs).  
A debug console (for `Debug.log()` output) can be found [here](http://www.seisaku.co.uk/console).

Some of the classes make use of the excellent [GreenSock Tweening Platform v11](http://www.greensock.com/v11/) and extend [PureMVC](http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_AS3/wiki/Downloads) classes, so the relevant SWCs have been included in the repo.
