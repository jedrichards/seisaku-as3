# Seisaku Lib
## AS3 library developed by Seisaku Limited

Not a framework, but a set of battle hardened constantly improved generic classes and utilities. At its core is a base class for view components called HideableSprite that provides a robust API for simple show/hide operations. Please feel free to use the library in whole, or in part, in anyway you see fit.

The files in the repository currently take the form of a Flash Builder Flex Library Project. The raw AS files, supporting SWCs and actual seisaku-lib SWC are all present in the repo.

Documentation can be found here www.seisaku.co.uk/docs.

An online version of the debug console can be found here www.seisaku.co.uk/console.
