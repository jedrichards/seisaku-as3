# seisakulib

An AS3 library developed by [Seisaku](http://www.seisaku.co.uk). A set of battle hardened constantly improved generic classes, utilities and view components. At its core is a base class for view components called `HideableSprite` that provides a robust API for show/hide operations and plays well with frameworks.

Documentation can be found [here](http://www.seisaku.co.uk/docs).

A debug console (for `Debug.log()` output) can be found [here](http://www.seisaku.co.uk/console).

Some of the classes make use of the excellent [GreenSock Tweening Platform v11](http://www.greensock.com/v11/) and extend [PureMVC](http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_AS3/wiki/Downloads) classes, so the relevant SWCs have been included in the repo.
